Health checking is the process where [load balancers] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)) or application delivery controller does periodic check on our applications to make sure that they are up and responding without any problems. If our applications are down for every reason or any of the services that our applications depends (A database, a distributed cache, web service, ect) the load balancer should detect this and stop sending traffic its way.
